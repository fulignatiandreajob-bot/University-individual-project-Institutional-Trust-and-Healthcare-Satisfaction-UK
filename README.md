# Institutional Trust and Healthcare Satisfaction: An Analysis of the UK Context

## Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between institutional trust and citizen satisfaction with the public healthcare system in the United Kingdom. Using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 11, we apply bivariate and multiple linear regression models to control for socio-demographic confounders and test whether this relationship is robust or spurious.

## Hypothesis
**H1:** There is a positive and significant relationship between trust in the national parliament/political institutions and satisfaction with the healthcare system. 
This relationship is theorized to stem from the perception that healthcare is a direct output of institutions: if citizens trust the political institutions, they are more likely to assume that public money is invested wisely and perceive the health care system as efficient.

**H2:** The positive relationship between institutional trust and healthcare satisfaction is moderated by political ideology.

## Methodology
The analysis proceeds in three steps:
1. **Bivariate Analysis:** A baseline regression model to assess the direct association between institutional trust and healthcare satisfaction.
2. **Exclusionary Strategy (Multiple Regression):** Introducing control variables to account for potential rival explanations and isolate the specific effect of institutional trust on healthcare satisfaction
3. **Multivariate Model with Moderator:** Adding the left-right ideological scale as a moderator to investigate whether the focal relationship is conditional upon an individual's political views.

## Data
The analysis uses the **European Social Survey (ESS) Round 11 (2023)**, specifically focusing on the United Kingdom sub-sample containing 1684 observations.

**Dependent Variable:** State of health services in the country nowadays (measured on a 0-10 scale representing satisfaction).

**Independent Variable:** Institutional Trust Index (a composite 0-10 scale derived from trust in the country's parliament, politicians, and political parties).

**Controls:** Age, Gender, Born in the UK, Years of Education, Household Income, Self-Reported Health Condition, and Subjective Well-being (Happiness).

**Moderator:** Left/Right political opinion (0-10 scale).
